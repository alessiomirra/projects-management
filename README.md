# PROJECTS MANAGEMENT APP 

This is a web app created using PHP in the backend, while for the frontend part, elements of Bootstrap were used, in addition to simple CSS and JavaScript.

##Â USAGE

For the database configuration, I have created the file 'config/database.public.php' where I show you the basic database configuration. 
Remember to rename this file as 'database.php' because it is called by this name in the index file. 
In the DbFactory class, I have set up the creation of the DSN for: MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL, and SQLite
